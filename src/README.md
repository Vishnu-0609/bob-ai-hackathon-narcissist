# Source Code

Place all your project's source code in this folder.

## Structure Guidelines

Organize your code logically. Here are common patterns — use whatever fits
your project:

### Web Application
```
src/
  backend/        ← API server code
  frontend/       ← UI code
  SIMPLE WORKFLOW/         ← simple demo working```


##sart workflow
cd src
cd SIMPLE WORKFLOW
pip install -r requirement.txt
python run.py

then open http://127.0.0.1:8000/

## Important Files to Include

- `requirements.txt` or `package.json` — dependency manifest
- `.env.example` — template for environment variables (NEVER commit `.env`)
- Any database migration files
- Configuration files

## What NOT to Include in src/

- `.env` files with real secrets
- Large binary files (use Git LFS or link externally)
- `node_modules/` or `venv/` (these are in `.gitignore`)
- Build artifacts (`dist/`, `build/`, `__pycache__/`)
